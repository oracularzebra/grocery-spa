# A  grocery list/ shopping list /todo list

There are two branches the master branch contains axios and fetch implemented
crud operations and the withoutApi branch uses localStorage for data storage.

Made using the create-react-app npm module, involving react js, node js.
It is a single-page application having all the basic crud operations written 
using the javascript fetch API. In a later relese I also implemented the axios for 
fetching the data and perfomring all the basic crud operationsl. React js plays a vital role, 
some of them react js functional components used in this project are useState(),useReducer() , 
useRef(),
useEffect(). json-server npm module has been used for starting the server with the
data/db.json file as the database.

There is a scope to implement some type of login system and authenticating the users so 
the webapp can retain the tasks, which will be stored in a database.
